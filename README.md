# One Pager Webseite for B.T.E. 

This is a single page website for the B.T.E. project. 

It supports desktop and mobile / responsive view modes.

So far this project does not use any Javascript and relies only on HTML and CSS.

It uses CSS variables and Flex Box for the layout.

The main font that that is used here is [https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Overpass](Overpass)

Comments and improvents are always welcome.


There is a work in progress version with a slider based on the lory slider.
